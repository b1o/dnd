- He also learns of 3 powerful swords that helped vanquish this enemy, wielded by 3 legendary heroes
- While reading, he discoveres an ancient artifact in the form of a dragon bone, shaped like a necklace
- on his way back to the city he notices a particular fox that is following him arround
- at first he pays no attention to it as it appears to be just a random beast in forest and he has more important events to attend to (deliver the information from Brotil island to the Von Zell Dojo Arhcives)
- After a month of this fox following him around his interest is finally poked a bit
- He starts wondering what is this fox doing following him for such a long time
- Few days away from his arrival at the Tomijeri town he gets ambushed by your common bandits
- The fox has followed him for over a month and a half now, swoops in and transforms into an actual humanoid person
- the bandits are driven away in fear by the sudden transformation, knowing the legends of the vengeful and merciless kitsune spirits
- The unfortunate situation is resolved and they share the rest of path together, while the character tries to find out more about this fox person that he has now identified as a member of the Kitsune race (because books and smart brain)
- the decides to share a small part of her past mainly just mundane things in hopes to satisfy the seemingly endless questions shooting out of the blue person (which does not actually help)
- finally they arrive the gates of the town
- The kitsune is not fond of the idea of going inside the town, since kitsune are known to be hunted for their tails
- The kitsune runs off without saying another word but does continue to dwell around the vicinity of the town in seach for potential new victims of her trickery
- gets rewarded with Ring of Protection for a successful mission and important findings and is promoted to an official archivist.
- over the corse of 2 weeks

- Charlie Von Zell and Seven try to help him, but to no avail
- Charlie is a known investigator and archivist, she specializes in both arcane and martial means of combat and has a reputation in the underground world of thieves and criminals, helping to bring most of them to justice.
- While Seven is a candidate of succession for the Von Zell Dojo in the city of Tomijeri, she is one of the strongest members of the archives and tends to lean more on ancient history and its preservation
- has to go behind the dojo's back to find more information
- learns about a big boss guy by the name of Drisko who deals in transfer of ancient artifacts/runes and decides to investigate him
- but before he manages to find anything else on Drisko, he receives a letter adressed to him by said Drisko
- inviting him to his "office" and claming he has work for a man such as him
- has to leave for the Dris tavern
- the kitsune from before notices the familiar blue face traveling along the same path, this time holding something of interest which appears to be a latter of sorts in his hands that grabs the attention of the fox person.
- The kitsune then decides to play a trick on the character by stealing away his letter.
- The letter has information on where the tavern is located and so the character, signed by drisco himself and acts as a proof of identity, so the character needs it quite badly back and so he chases after the fox
- The kitsune reads the letter and notices familiar symbols (runes) tied to her past in a the way where she breaks some kind of seal and unleashes some bad things
- The kitsune then changes her mind of just playing a trick on the blue person, and decides to ask for help since it seems like he knows more about these runes
- The character is a bit annoyed by the trick so he spends some time thinking of weather he should help or not, but his interest in ancient artifacts and runes is way too big to just dismiss a clue like
- but no matter the current situation with the fox, drisko's request has to be dealt with first
- so they decide to travel together to the tavern
- relationship with fox person improved
